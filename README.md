# ESP32 LoRaWAN Mote (end node) #

Vist https://electronicspojects.wordpress.com/2018/11/23/esp32-lorawan-mote/ for a full walk through of how to set it up.

Work on this is still in progress and the above code is used in the Arduino IDE and has been tried and tested on a Heltec WiFi LoRa V1 Board bought from here https://www.banggood.com/868MHz-915MHz-SX1276-ESP32-LoRa-0_96-Inch-Blue-OLED-Display-Bluetooth-WIFI-Lora-Kit-32-Module-p-1248583.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN and set up on TTN which receives the data sent from the Mote. Please read the README.md of all the labiries used with the folder for help in setting up till i get the how done. CHEERS!!!! and have fun......

Download ZIP and on a windoows machine go to Documents->Arduino and extract there. Build one of the two examples in the root of the extracted folder for ESP32 and upload to the board. 

If you are a noob to this please wait for the how to before asking any question.
